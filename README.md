# ValStatusBot
I got bored when the APAC region of VALORANT suddenly had an emergency maintenance and thought, "Hey... Is there a twitter account for this?". Turns out there wasn't, thus ValStatusBot was born.  

You can see the instance running the latest commit at [@ValStatusBot](https://twitter.com/ValStatusBot).

## Installation
If you want to run an instance yourself, go for it! Constructive changes are encouraged to be PR'd, though.

`npm i` or `yarn`

Copy `secrets.example.js` to `secrets.js` and fill in the appropriate values

Change the Owner ID in `constants.js`
